# shuffle-deck

As an exercise in our September 2016 Perl Mongers meeting, we will be writing code to shuffle a deck of cards.

## Information

You will need to do the following so we can test your shuffle!

1. Create a new directory with your "team name". You can choose what you like.

2. Create a perl module in that folder, named appropriately and with the right package name. e.g.  'myteam' folder, MyTeam.pm file, 'package MyTeam;' in the file.

3. Create a subroutine named 'shuffle'.  This subroutine will receive an unshuffled deck of cards.  It should shuffle the deck and return it.

## Example

An example has been created, please see the 'example' folder.
