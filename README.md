# shuffle-deck

As an exercise in our September 2016 Perl Mongers meeting, we will be writing code to shuffle a deck of cards.

## Information

You will need to do the following so we can test your shuffle!

1. Create a new directory with your "team name". You can choose what you like. Also create a 'Mongers' directory in that folder. e.g:

    mkdir -p myteam/Mongers

2. Create a perl module in the Mongers folder folder named Shuffle. e.g:

    vim myteam/Mongers/Shuffle.pm

    # make sure to add 'package Mongers::Shuffle;' at the top of the file!

3. Create a subroutine named 'shuffle'.  This subroutine will receive an unshuffled deck of cards.  It should shuffle the deck and return it.

## Example

An example has been created, please see the 'example' folder.
